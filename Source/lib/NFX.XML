            <summary>
            Represents a pile of objects - a custom memory heap that can store native CLR objects in a tightly-serialized form.
            Piles can be either local (allocate local RAM on the server), or distributed (allocate RAM on many servers).
            This class is designed primarily for applications that need to store/cache very many (100s of millions on local, billions on distributed) of objects in RAM
            (and/or possibly on disk) without causing the local CLR's GC scans of huge object graphs.
            Implementors of this interface are custom memory managers that favor the GC performance in apps with many objects at the cost of higher CPU usage.
            The implementor must be thread-safe for all operations unless stated otherwise on a member level.
            The memory represented by this class as a whole is not synchronizable, that is - it does not support functions like Interlocked-family, Lock, MemoryBarriers and the like
             that regular RAM supports. Should a need arise to interlock within the pile - a custom CLR-based lock must be used to syncronize access to pile as a whole, for example:
              a Get does not impose a lock on ALL concurrent writes throught the pile (a write does not block all gets either).

            <summary>
            Represents a pointer to the pile object (object stored in a pile).
            The reference may be local or distributed in which case the NodeID is>=0.
            Distributed pointers are very useful for organizing piles of objects distributed among many servers, for example
             for "Big Memory" implementations or large neural networks where nodes may inter-connect between servers.
            The CLR reference to the IPile is not a part of this struct for performance and practicality reasons, as
             it is highly unlikely that there are going to be more than one instance of a pile in a process, however
             should more than 1 pile be allocated than this pointer would need to be wrapped in some other structure along with source IPile reference

            Implements service that stores object in proccess's memory, asynchronously saving objects to external non-volatile storage 
            upon change and synchronously saving objects upon service stop. This service is useful for scenarious like ASP.NET
            volatile domain that can be torn down at any time.
            Note for ASP.NET uses: the key difference of this approach from .NET session state management is the fact that this service never blocks
             object CheckIn() operations as backing store is being updated asynchronously.
            This class is thread-safe unless specified otherwise on a property/method level

            <summary>
            Represents an efficient in-memory cache of expiring optionally-prioritized objects.
            This class is higly optimized for caching of business objects in data store implementations and does not guarantee that
            all hash collisions are handled, that is - some data may be overridden. The implementation relies on 2 stage hashing, where the second collision replaces the
             existing item with the colliding one if items are equal in their priorities. The degree of collisions is controlled by 'bucketSize' and 'recPerPage' parameters that
             are passed to the store per table, so basically the tables are capped at a certain size and can not change (bucketSize*recPerPage).
            The lookup implementation is 100% lock-free, whereas the degree of mutability-related locking is controlled by 'lockCount' per table.  
            This class is thread safe for reading and writing cache items, however it does not guarantee instant read/write consistency between threads.

            Depending on a particular store setup this logical name may or may not represent physical servers/locations in the store.
            Every store implementation maps logical paths to physical servers and/or shards. This feature provides very high degree
             of distributed database design flexibility, as some parcels may represent common/dictionary data that does not need to be sharded,
            whereas others may represent purely transactional high-volume data that needs to be sharded.

            Specifies modes of wrapping handling of parcel payload.
            This setting controls whether parcel's payload is sub-serialized into inner byte[].
            When a parcel contains simple typed data payload (i.e. typedrow), then wrapping its content in extra byte[] would
             cause extra overhead in which case NotWrapped mode should be used (default).

            <summary>
            Represents a Global Distributed ID key (key field) used in distributed databases that identify entities with a combination of unsigned 32 bit integer
             'Era' and unsigned 64 bit integer 'ID'. The first 32 bit integer is an 'era' in which the 'ID' (64 bit) was created, consequently
            a GDID is a 12 byte = 96 bit integer that can hold 2^96 = 79,228,162,514,264,337,593,543,950,336 combinations. 
            The ID consists of two segments: 4 bit authority + 60 bits counter. Authority segment occupies the most significant 4 bits of uint64, so
             the system may efficiently query the data store to identify the highest stored ID value in a range.
            Authorities identify one of 16 possible ID generation sources in the global distributed system, therefore ID duplications are not 
            possible between authorities. 
            Within a single era, GDID structure may identify 2^60 = 1,152,921,504,606,846,976(per authority) * 16(authorities) = 2^64 = 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 total combinations.
            Because of such a large number of combinations supported by GDID.ID alone (having the same Era), some systems may always use Era=0 and only store the ID part 
            (i.e. as UNSIGNED BIGINT in SQL datastores)

            Represents a data store that works with large distributed systems that support OLTP-style processing
            and provide data querying, caching, partitioning/sharding, failover and replication.
            These systems are designed to handle billions of rows that need to be accessed by millions of active concurrent users,
             so the design is specific to this model that scales horizontally. There is no need to use this technology for medium and smaller data stores
             as it imposes specific requirements on how application is written/interacts with the backend system. This technology is based on the idea
             of Parcels - an atomic unit of data change. Parcels get replicated between hosts for failover and performance reasons.
            Note: 
             NFX library does not provide the implementation for this technology, only marker interfaces so developers can plan for distributed backends
             in future

            Distributed data stores hold single or multiple named data banks instances: Bank = global data bank name, a named instance of a distributed database.
            Banks are logical isolation containers in large datasets. Store implementations may use it for physical isolation as well.
            Every bank implements a particular schema - a structure suitable for some business purpose.
            A store may support multiple schemas, but every particular database bank implements only one schema.
            Named instances of database banks with the same schema may be used to house data for different clients or environments. 
            Bank name example: "PROD-Data", "DEV-Data", "EnterpriseA", "CustomerX" etc.
            
            Every Bank is further broken down by Areas that can be accessed/addressed by their names.
            Areas contain shards that partition large volumes of data horizontally, they define how data is partitioned and where it is stored

            <summary>
            Describes a data parcel - a piece of logically-grouped data that gets fetched from/comitted into a distributed backend system.
            Parcels represent an atomic unit of change, a changeset that gets replicated between failover hosts.
            Every parcel has a Payload property that stores business data of interest that the parcel contains.
            This class is designed in such way that Payload property (unwrapped data) is not serialized, instead a byte[](wrapped data) is serialized.
            This is needed because an instance of Parcel may travel between many hosts that do not need to serialize/deserialize possibly complex business
            object that parcel contains.
            Parcels wrap their payload - when parcels get transported between hosts only parcel metadata (Parcel class fields) get serialized/deserialized by 
            hosts in the data supply chain, so metadata is available for tasks like parcel routing and cache policy adjustment, but the business data (the payload) must be 
            unwrapped first before it can be used. This design promotes efficient storage in distributed cache systems, i.e. the data origination host may keep cached version
            in an unwrapped state (not serialized) so business payload is ready for access right away without deserialization. 
            On the other hand, the intermediary parcel relays do not need to deserialize/serialize payload every time as it may be complex and waste significant processing time.
            This class is not thread-safe. Use DeepClone() to create 100% copies for working in multiple threads.
            This particular class serves as a very base for all Parcel implementations

            Merges other parcel instances into this one. 
            A parcel type may support merging (when DataParcel attribute SupportsMerge is set to true) of data from other parcels/versions into this instance.
            This parcel must not be sealed as merge may change the payload in which case TRUE is returned. The parcel needs to be sealed again after the change.
            If a call to this method returns false, then nothing was changed as this instance already contains the latest data/could not be merged.
            Merging is used for version conflict resolution: servers check if the type of the updated parcel instance SupportsMerge, then if it does, Opens parcel 
            and calls this method passing other versions in question to this method. The framework does not impose a limit on the supplied parcel types, however 
            most of the parcel types support merge only with the same-typed parcel instances.

            If parcel is ParcelPayloadWrappingMode.NotWrapped then forgets a reference to payload data which is transmitted(serialized).
            This method is usually used by business code after Parcel instance gets sent to backend, then this method is called, then

             if a parcel instance needs to be cached for subsequent parallel modifications then DeepClone() should be used.
             DeepClone() will recreate the wrapped payload buffer, so this method does not need to be called in this case

            <summary>
            Describes a data parcel - a piece of logically-grouped data that gets fetched from/comitted into a distributed backend system.
            Parcels represent an atomic unit of change, a changeset that gets replicated between failover hosts.
            Every parcel has a Payload property that stores business data of interest that the parcel contains.
            This class is designed in such way that Payload property (unwrapped data) is not serialized, instead a byte[](wrapped data) is serialized.
            This is needed because an instance of Parcel may travel between many hosts that do not need to serialize/deserialize possibly complex business
            object that parcel contains.
            Parcels wrap their payload - when parcels get transported between hosts only parcel metadata (Parcel class fields) get serialized/deserialized by 
            hosts in the data supply chain, so metadata is available for tasks like parcel routing and cache policy adjustment, but the business data (the payload) must be 
            unwrapped first before it can be used. This design promotes efficient storage in distributed cache systems, i.e. the data origination host may keep cached version
            in an unwrapped state (not serialized) so business payload is ready for access right away without deserialization. 
            On the other hand, the intermediary parcel relays do not need to deserialize/serialize payload every time as it may be complex and waste significant processing time.
            This class is not thread-safe.
            This particular class serves as a very base for distributed data store implementations

            "alive@hostname", while long names are of the form
            "alive@host.fully.qualified.domainname". Erlang has special
            requirements regarding the use of the short and long formats, in
            particular they cannot be mixed freely in a network of
            communicating nodes, however Jinterface makes no distinction. See
            the Erlang documentation for more information about nodenames.
            
            The constructors for the AbstractNode classes will create names
            exactly as you provide them as long as the name contains '@'. If
            the string you provide contains no '@', it will be treated as an
            alivename and the name of the local host will be appended,
            resulting in a shortname. Nodenames longer than 255 characters will
            be truncated without warning.
            
            Upon initialization, this class attempts to read the file
            .erlang.cookie in the user's home directory, and uses the trimmed
            first line of the file as the default cookie by those constructors
            lacking a cookie argument. If for any reason the file cannot be
            found or read, the default cookie will be set to the empty string
            (""). The location of a user's home directory is determined using
            the system environment "HOME", which may not be automatically set
            on all platforms

             Provides a simple mechanism for exchanging messages with Erlang

             </summary>
             <remarks>
             Each mailbox is associated with a unique <see cref="T:NFX.Erlang.ErlPid"/>
             that contains information necessary for delivery of messages.
             When sending messages to named processes or mailboxes, the sender
             pid is made available to the recipient of the message. When sending
             messages to other mailboxes, the recipient can only respond if the
             sender includes the pid as part of the message contents. The sender
             can determine his own pid by calling <see cref="P:NFX.Erlang.ErlMbox.Self"/>.
            
             Mailboxes can be named, either at creation or later. Messages
             can be sent to named mailboxes and named Erlang processes without
             knowing the <see cref="T:NFX.Erlang.ErlPid"/> that identifies the mailbox.
             This is neccessary in order to set up initial communication between
             parts of an application. Each mailbox can have at most one name.
            
             Messages to remote nodes are externalized for transmission, and
             as a result the recipient receives a <b>copy</b> of the original
             C# object. To ensure consistent behaviour when messages are sent
             between local mailboxes, such messages are cloned before delivery.
            
             Additionally, mailboxes can be linked in much the same way as
             Erlang processes. If a link is active when a mailbox is closed
             any linked Erlang processes or ErlMbox's will be
             sent an exit signal. As well, exit signals will be (eventually)
             sent if a mailbox goes out of scope and its Dispose method called.
             However due to the nature of
             finalization (i.e. C# makes no guarantees about when Dispose
             will be called) it is recommended that you
             always explicitly close mailboxes if you are using links instead of
             relying on finalization to notify other parties in a timely manner.
            
             When retrieving messages from a mailbox that has received an exit
             signal, an <see cref="T:NFX.Erlang.ErlExit"/> exception will be
             raised. Note that the exception is queued in the mailbox along with
             other messages, and will not be raised until it reaches the head of
             the queue and is about to be retrieved

            <remarks>
            If the remote process subsequently exits or the mailbox is
            closed, a subsequent attempt to retrieve a message through this
            mailbox will cause an {@link Exit Exit}
            exception to be raised. Similarly, if the sending mailbox is
            closed, the linked mailbox or process will receive an exit
            signal.
            
            If the remote process cannot be reached in order to set the
            link, the exception is raised immediately.

            <remarks>
            Instances of this class are created to package header and
            payload information in received Erlang messages so that the
            recipient can obtain both parts with a single call to
            <see cref="M:NFX.Erlang.ErlMbox.receiveMsg"/>
            
            The header information that is available is as follows:
            <ul>
            <li>a tag indicating the type of message</li>
            <li>the intended recipient of the message, either as a
                <see cref="T:NFX.Erlang.ErlPid"/> or as a <see cref="T:NFX.Erlang.ErlAtom"/>, but never both.</li>
            <li>(sometimes) the sender of the message. Due to some eccentric
                characteristics of the Erlang distribution protocol, not
                all messages have information about the sending process. In
                particular, only messages whose tag is <see cref="F:NFX.Erlang.ErlMsg.Tag.RegSend"/>
                contain sender information.</li>
            </ul>
            
            Message are sent using the Erlang external format (see separate
            documentation). When a message is received and delivered to the
            recipient <see cref="T:NFX.Erlang.ErlMbox"/>, the body of the message is still
            in this external representation until <see cref="P:NFX.Erlang.ErlMsg.Msg"/>
            is called, at which point the message is decoded. A copy of the
            decoded message is stored in the OtpMsg so that subsequent calls to
            <see cref="P:NFX.Erlang.ErlMsg.Msg"/> do not require that the message be decoded
            a second time.

            Introduces external entropy into the generation sequence by adding a sample into the ring buffer.
            Call FeedExternalEntropySample(int sample) method from places that have true entropy values, i.e.
             a network-related code may have good entropy sources in server applications.
             External entropy sources may rely on user-dependent actions, i.e.:
              number of bytes/requests received per second, dollar(or cent remainders) amount of purchases made (on a server),
              zip codes of customers, IP addresses of site visitors, average noise level sampled on an open WAVE device(microphone),
               mouse position (i.e. in GUI app) etc...
             This class MAY be crypto-safe if it is fed a good entropy data at high rate, however that depends on the use pattern.
             The framework implementation feeds some entropy from Glue and cache components infrequently (once every few seconds),

            This class is not thread safe in general, however Glue allows for concurrent remote calls via the same endpoint instance 
            if the following conditions are met:
             1). The endpoint instance has not reserved its transport (ReserveTransport=false)
             2). Either remote contract is stateless OR none of the concurrent calls are constructing/destructing remote instance
            The second condition ensures that stateful remote instance is consistent, otherwise operations may get executed 
             out-of-order in the multithreaded scenario

            Sets RemoteInstance to null. This method is needed when the same instance of client endpoint is used to make subsequent statefull calls
             to different server instances. Call this method before calling [Constructor]-decorated remote method or making the first call to
              InstanceLifetime.AutoconstructedStateful servers.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            The remote instance ID is retained locally even after a call to [Destructor]-decorated remote method. This is needed because
             a call to destructor may be asynchronous and it may be necessary to know the ID of the instance (that has already died on remote host) after call returns.
            Call ForgetRemoteInstance() to deterministically nullify the local cached ID.

            Indicates whether transport instance should not be released after a call and be reserved per this endpoint instance.
            Be carefull when setting this property to true as this action can really impede the system performance as transport is reserved
             until this property is either reset to false or endpoint instance is disposed. Transport reservation reduces call latency
              and is mostly beneficial in synchronous bindings. Warning: client endpoint with reserved transport is NOT THREAD SAFE for making
             parallel calls! Set this property to true only when latency is very critical and only 1 dedicated thread is working with this

            Provides a base for various file system abstractions.
            FileSystem abstractions are mostly useful for working with components/classes that may need to inter-operate not only with local file system
             but also with distributed systems like ApacheHDFS, SVN, GIT, or Aum Cluster Big-Transactional File System (BoltFS).
             NFX library provides compatibility wrapper 'NFX.IO.FileSystem.Local.LocalFileSystem' for access to local machine file system  
             (which is based on this class and is implemented using a traditional System.IO.* set of classes).
            The FileSystem abstraction supports the following concepts: versioning, transactions, metadata, security; however it does not guarantee that
             every implementation is capable of providing all of these functions. Query "GeneralCapabilities" and "InstanceCapabilities" to see what functions
              are supported by a particular instance.
            This class is not thread-safe unless stated otherwise on method level, however multiple threads are allowed to obtain their own FileSystemSession

            </summary>
            <remarks>
             Keep in mind that a particular datastore implementation may have to deal with hybrid distributed backends where different tables get stored 
             in different repositories (different architectures i.e. NoSQL, HDFS, and some RDB SQL all in different locations),
             consequently one can not make assumption about writing SQLs of any kind in business code - that is what CRUD concept is for as it abstracts 
             this into provider implementation.
             Architectural note: unlike Hibernate, LinqTo* and the like, the NFX.CRUD architecture purposely does not allow developers 
             to write query scripts in higher-language like C#. This is because translation of such a high-level language abstraction into
              highly optimized SQL/(and or other script) per particular backend is impossible because such language can not incapsulate
             the optimization features of all possible data backends (i.e. ORACLE vs MongoDB vs Redis vs Files in HDFS).
            CRUD queries need to support selects from tables with millions of rows, or reads from collections with millions of documents,
            or parse millions of lines from files stored in Hadooop servers, thus every particular provider for every particular business app
            must expose custom-written queries by name. Those queries are usually highly optimized for particular platform 
            (i.e. using db-specific hints, common table subexpressions, groupping sets etc.).
            Also, a provider may elect to SELECT * from a table named like Query object, when a hand-written script with such name is not found

            The operation is performed per particular targetName (name of physical backend). Simply put, this method allows

            The operation is performed per particular targetName (name of physical backend).

            An example: suppose current MongoDB collection stores 3 fields for name, and we want to collapse First/Last/Middle name fields into one field.
            If we change rowschema then it will only contain 1 field which is not present in the database, however those 'older' fields will get populated 
            into AmorphousData giving us an option to merge older 3 fields into 1 within AfterLoad() implementation

            <summary>
            Represents an ultra-efficient 64 bit in-process-wide unique identifier "Fast Id".
            The ID is going to wrap-around after at least 2 weeks (19 days).
            The ID consists of 3 segments: [timestamp: 24bit][threadseed: 24bit][counter: 16 bit].
            This is needed because: 
             a). FID stays unique after process restarts  
             b). This design does not use interlock on global seed, but uses thread-static vars which is 10-20 times faster
             
            The timestamp is the number of 100ms intervals elapsed since Jan 1 2015 expressed as a 24 bit unsigned int, which gives 2^24 = 16,777,216 combinations
            which covers 19 days (around 2 weeks) at 100 msec resolution, consequently the ID will generate duplicates after this period.
            This struct is useful for creating unique IDs for protocol/traffic messages that live for a limited time (no more than 2 weeks).
            Caution: This ID does not identify the machine or process, only items within the process, however when a hosting process restarts(i.e. crash or reboot)
            the new IDs will not collide with IDs generated right before the crash for at least 14 days (14 day sliding window).
            In a parallel test on 6 Core i7 3.2 GHz this class generates 405 million IDs/sec, which is 57 times faster than Guid that only generates 7 million IDs/sec

            Registry performs lock-free lookup which speeds-up many concurrent operations that need to map names into objects.

            Based class for implementing test and non-test logging services.
            Destinations may fail and the message will be failed-over into another destination in the same logger 
             as specified by 'failover' attribute of destination. This attribute is also present on service level.
            Cascading failover is not supported (failover of failovers). Another consideration is that messages 
             get sent into destinations synchronously by internal thread so specifying too many destinations may
             limit overall LogService throughput. In complex scenarios consider using LogServiceDestination instead.

            Represents a class that is immediately returned after transport sends RequestMsg.
            This class provides CallStatus and RequestID properties where the later is used to match the incoming ResponseMsg.
            CallSlots are kinds of "spirit-less" mailboxes that keep state about the call, but do not posess any threads/call events.
            Working with CallSlots from calling code's existing thread of execution is the most efficient way of working with Glue (in high load cases), as
             it does not create extra object instances (tasks do) for asynchronous coordination and continuation.
            It is possible to obtain an instance of CallSlot.AsTask in which case that instance is registered with the framework-internal reactor
             so task does complete normally even on timeout, however, in high-throughput apps (10K+ calls per second) this method is not the most efficient one
             as it allocates additional objects (task, list entry etc.) that eventually increase GC load for long runs.
             Note: A 3.2 Ghz 4-Core I7 server with 8Gb of ram can easily handle 40K 2-way calls a second (given little business server logic and simple payload).

            Represents a list of health checks to be performed.
            Health checks are classes derived from BaseCheck class and must implement DoRun() method
             that performs application-specific checking. CheckList obtains a list of Check instances
              from assemblies supplied to its constructor. 
            Health checks are executed in no predictable order.
            If particular execution order is necessary then a check has to be written to explicitly
             coordinate sub-checks.
            The class is thread safe for all operations.

            A special case is reserved for strings which are immutable yet reference types, in which case a special handle INLINED_STRING_HANDLE is set to indicate that 
             "Metadata" really contains string data that this handle should resolve into. Check "IsInlinedString" property to see if string was inlined.
            Check "IsInlinedValueType" is set to true when a struct/valuetype is inlined and "Metadata" contains type spec

            A format that writes into binary files in an efficient way using variable-length integers, strings and meta handles.
            Developers may derive new formats that support custom serialization of their business-related types. This may increase performance dramatically.
            For example, in a drawing application a new format may derive from SlimFormat to natively serialize Point and PolarPoint structs to yield faster serialization times.
            NFX.Serialization.Slim.SlimSlimSerializer is capable of SlimFormat-derived format injection, in which case it will automatically discover new types that are directly supported
            by the format.

            This method is mostly used on client (vs. server) to prevent process memory-inspection attack.
            Its is usually called right after Login() was called.
            Implementers may consider forcing post-factum GC.Collect() on all generations to make sure that orphaned

            <summary>
            Represents a general permission abstraction - where permission type represents the path/name of the permission
             in User's rights and .ctor takes specific parameters to check while authorizing user.
             Permission-derived class represents a certain permission type, whereas its instance is a check for particular desired level.
             To authorize certain actions, one creates an instance of Permission-derived class passing in its .ctor required
              access levels, then calls a Check() method that returns true if action is authorized. 
              
            This scheme provides a great deal of flexibility, i.e. for very complex security cases developers may inherit leaf-level permissions from intermediate ones
              that have logic tied to session-level variables, this way user's access may vary by permission/session state, i.e. a user may have 
               "Patient.Master" level 4 access in database "A", while having acess denied to the same named permission in database "B".
            User's database, or system instance is a flag in user-session context

            This mode is beneficial for cases when many object instances of various types need to be transmitted

            <summary>
            Implements Slim serialization algorithm that relies on an injectable SlimFormat-derivative (through .ctor) paremeter.
            This class was designed for highly-efficient serialization of types without versioning.
            SlimSerializer supports a concept of "known types" that save space by not emitting their names into stream.
            Performance note:
            This serializer yields on average 1/4 serialization and 1/2 deserialization times while compared to BinaryFormatter.
            Serialization of Record-instances usually takes 1/6 of BinaryFormatter time.
            Format takes 1/10 space for records and 1/2 for general object graphs.
            Such performance is achieved because of dynamic compilation of type-specific serialization/deserialization methods.
            This type is thread-safe for serializations/deserializations when TypeMode is set to "PerCall"

            <summary>
            Efficiently calculates the throttling rate over a number of seconds.
            The algorithm implements a variation of token bucket algorithm that
            doesn't require to add tokens to the bucket on a timer but rather it
            maintains a cirtular buffer of tokens with resolution of 1/BucketsPerSec.
            The Add() function is used to add items to a bucket
            associated with the timestamp passed as the first argument to the
            function. The Sum() returns the total number of
            items over the given interval of seconds. The items automatically expire
            when the time moves on the successive invocations of the Add() method.
