# SERBENCH - Serializer Benchmarking Suite
The purpose of this tool is to test the performance/capabilities of various
serializers available for the CLR/.NET platform.

Serbench is based on NFX Application Model, therefore it supports many configurable/pluggable features right out of the box:
* **Logging** with various destinations (console, file, db etc.)
* Test data output into **DataStore** (i.e. store data is RDBMS, CSV, JSON, etc.)
* **Visualize** test data via an HTML/Web application (generated by the tool)

Both tests and serializers are descendants of corresponding base classes which can
be **injected via a named config** into the tool. This approach allows for **high degree of flexibility**
as **everything is configurable**.

Every **test determines** what **payload kind/type, pattern and size** is used against every serializer, so
the tool permutes **all test instances and serializer instances** to test different combinations.

The dynamic/injectable nature of Serbench allows for coverage of many non-trivial use cases like **parallel serialization**, **stateful client/server channels**. These kind of tests are usually overlooked/not considered by testers. 

Not all serializers support all features, i.e. ProtoBuf does not support cyclical object graphs. This
 is normal and actually is expected to be discovered by this tool.
 
The tool relies on the NFX library (which is purposely inlined under Source/lib), hence it does not have much code in it:

Serbench **DOES NOT give ANY PREFERENCE to ANY PARTICULAR SERIALIZER**. Any serializer may be abstracted and tested against the tests that are already established and executed against others.
